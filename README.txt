ColorHighlighter - is a plugin for the Sublime text 2, which underlays selected hexadecimal colorcodes (like "#FFFFFF" or "0xFFFFFF") with their real color. I could underlay em all right after file loading, but i don't like a bunch of colored spots in my screen, so it only happens when you select one.
